## Pull Request

1. Pull request is a mechanism for a developer to notify other team members 
that a feature is completed. This lets everybody involved know that they 
need to review the code and merge it into the main branch.


2. Pull request is a dedicated forum for discussing the proposed feature. 
3. Teammates can post feedback in the pull request 
4. Teammates can tweak the feature by pushing follow-up commits
5. All we are doing is requesting that another developer to pull a branch 
from your repository into their repository
